# Discount Price Prediction
Artificial Intelligence is an integral part of all major e-commerce companies today. Today's online retail platforms are heavily powered by algorithms and applications that use AI. Machine learning is used in a variety of ways, from inventory control and quality assurance in the warehouse to product recommendations and sales demographics on the website.

I want to create a promotional campaign for an e-commerce store and offer discounts to customers in the hopes that this might increase our sales.

I have been provided descriptions of products on Amazon and Flipkart, including details like product title, ratings, reviews, and actual prices. In this challenge, I will predict discounted prices of the listed products based on their ratings and actual prices.
